This is a recreation of all of Neave's experiments at a range of water contents 0.1,0.2 wt% to 1 to see if any of these more closely match his observations as water content might depress the plagioclase liquidus and make results nearer to his, particularly as he didn't seem particularly confident of the water content in his experiments
